                        <h3>Travel and Tours Website</h3>
                        <p>Travel & Tours Web Project – <a href="https://thenaturestrail.com/">TheNaturesTrail.com</a> <br>
                        I independently designed and developed The Nature’s Trail, a travel and tour services website aimed at showcasing nature-based travel experiences. 
                        The project was built using WordPress as the main CMS, with custom enhancements through HTML and CSS to achieve a clean, responsive, and visually appealing layout. 
                        I was responsible for the entire website lifecycle — from gathering client requirements and wireframing to design customization, content integration, and performance optimization. 
                        In addition to development, I also provided full client support, handled feedback and revisions, and ensured the site met the client’s vision for a user-friendly and professional travel platform. 
                        The website features tour package listings, contact forms, blog integration, and a smooth navigation experience tailored for adventure and nature lovers.</p>

                        <h3>Supply Chain Management System</h3>
                        <p>This project was developed for a client to streamline and optimize their internal supply chain operations. 
                            It featured three key user roles—Admin, Supplier, and Customer—each with customized dashboards and functionalities. 
                            The system was designed to automate inventory tracking, manage orders efficiently, and provide real-time updates on deliveries, significantly improving workflow transparency and coordination across departments.
                            <br>
                            In this project, I led the design and management aspects. My responsibilities included creating wireframes and user flows, designing intuitive UI layouts using Canva, and overseeing the entire project timeline. 
                            I coordinated with the development team, conducted thorough testing to ensure a smooth user experience, and maintained regular communication with the client to gather feedback and make necessary refinements. Through effective project management and team leadership, I ensured the successful and timely delivery of the system.</p>
