    <!-- about me -->
    <div class="portion" role="about" id="Aboutme">
        <h2>Hey! I'm Priyanshi</h2>
        <p>
            I’m a passionate front-end developer who enjoys the process of turning ideas into real, interactive
            web experiences.
            I specialize in building clean, responsive, and engaging user interfaces using HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, and React — and
            I’m constantly learning and leveling up.
        </p>
        <p>
            My journey into web development wasn’t a straight line. I didn’t come from a fancy bootcamp or a
            tech degree (yet).
            Instead, I dove deep into self-learning — exploring platforms like The Odin Project, building
            real-world projects, and taking on freelance gigs that taught me more than any tutorial ever could.
            Every project I take on isn’t just about code — it’s about understanding people, solving problems,
            and delivering something that works beautifully across devices.
        </p>

        <h3>More About me :</h3>
        <p>It all started with a simple attraction—just the vibe of working on a computer. I didn’t know much
            about what the tech world actually held, but I knew I wanted to be part of it. During the COVID-19
            lockdown, while attending online classes from home, I stumbled into online learning. What began as
            casual curiosity quickly turned into a deep dive: one course led to another, and soon I was hooked.
            I ended up completing 20–30 online courses across different domains—mostly in Computer Science, but
            also in English, music, and more.
            <br><br> At that time, I was exploring out of excitement, unaware of the bigger, more complex world
            that existed beyond the screen. Once things reopened and I got back to physical classes, I started
            spending time in the CS labs. That’s where things became more real. I’d experiment, build small
            things, and try out concepts on my own. I didn’t always have someone to ask for help—so I taught
            myself, and often ended up helping others instead. That phase taught me resilience, independence,
            and how much I enjoy solving problems.
            <br><br> Later, I took a year to focus on myself—not just skills, but mindset, communication, and
            connection. I made friends and professional connections both online and offline, from across the
            country and around the world. Talking to people from different backgrounds and experiences helped me
            see new perspectives—and boosted my confidence a lot.
            <br><br> Then came internships—one after another—each adding something new. I learned how to work in
            teams, communicate clearly, and collaborate effectively. I got hands-on experience not just in
            development, but also in client support and project communication. I often handled direct client
            queries while contributing to project development. These experiences taught me the value of empathy,
            clarity, and responsibility in tech.
            <br><br>Over time, I realized I wanted to do more than just follow tasks—I wanted to build something
            real, meaningful, and scalable. That led me to focus on strengthening my core skills again and work
            on real-world projects that solve real problems. Now, I’m in the phase where I’m continuously
            building, learning, and growing—actively looking for new challenges and opportunities to contribute
            to impactful work while learning from talented teams.
