                        I independently designed and developed The Nature’s Trail, a travel and tour services website aimed at showcasing nature-based travel experiences. 
                        The project was built using WordPress as the main CMS, with custom enhancements through HTML and CSS to achieve a clean, responsive, and visually appealing layout. 
                        I was responsible for the entire website lifecycle — from gathering client requirements and wireframing to design customization, content integration, and performance optimization. 
                        In addition to development, I also provided full client support, handled feedback and revisions, and ensured the site met the client’s vision for a user-friendly and professional travel platform. 
                        The website features tour package listings, contact forms, blog integration, and a smooth navigation experience tailored for adventure and nature lovers.</p>

                            It featured three key user roles—Admin, Supplier, and Customer—each with customized dashboards and functionalities. 
                            The system was designed to automate inventory tracking, manage orders efficiently, and provide real-time updates on deliveries, significantly improving workflow transparency and coordination across departments.

                            In this project, I led the design and management aspects. My responsibilities included creating wireframes and user flows, designing intuitive UI layouts using Canva, and overseeing the entire project timeline. 
                            I coordinated with the development team, conducted thorough testing to ensure a smooth user experience, and maintained regular communication with the client to gather feedback and make necessary refinements. Through effective project management and team leadership, I ensured the successful and timely delivery of the system.</p>

    <!-- about me -->
     <div class="about portion glass-box-black" role="about">
      <div class="about-content">
        <h2>Hey! I'm Priyanshi</h2>
        <p>
            I’m a passionate front-end developer who enjoys the process of turning ideas into real, interactive web experiences. 
            I specialize in building clean, responsive, and engaging user interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React — and 
            I’m constantly learning and leveling up.
        </p>
        <p>
            My journey into web development wasn’t a straight line. I didn’t come from a fancy bootcamp or a tech degree (yet). 
            Instead, I dove deep into self-learning — exploring platforms like The Odin Project, building real-world projects, and taking on freelance gigs that taught me more than any tutorial ever could. Every project I take on isn’t just about code — it’s about understanding people, solving problems, and delivering something that works beautifully across devices.
        </p>

        <h3>More About me :</h3>
        <p>It all started with a simple attraction—just the vibe of working on a computer. I didn’t know much about what the tech world actually held, but I knew I wanted to be part of it. During the COVID-19 lockdown, while attending online classes from home, I stumbled into online learning. What began as casual curiosity quickly turned into a deep dive: one course led to another, and soon I was hooked. I ended up completing 20–30 online courses across different domains—mostly in Computer Science, but also in English, music, and more. 
        <br><br> At that time, I was exploring out of excitement, unaware of the bigger, more complex world that existed beyond the screen. Once things reopened and I got back to physical classes, I started spending time in the CS labs. That’s where things became more real. I’d experiment, build small things, and try out concepts on my own. I didn’t always have someone to ask for help—so I taught myself, and often ended up helping others instead. That phase taught me resilience, independence, and how much I enjoy solving problems. 
        <br><br> Later, I took a year to focus on myself—not just skills, but mindset, communication, and connection. I made friends and professional connections both online and offline, from across the country and around the world. Talking to people from different backgrounds and experiences helped me see new perspectives—and boosted my confidence a lot.
        <br><br> Then came internships—one after another—each adding something new. I learned how to work in teams, communicate clearly, and collaborate effectively. I got hands-on experience not just in development, but also in client support and project communication. I often handled direct client queries while contributing to project development. These experiences taught me the value of empathy, clarity, and responsibility in tech.
        <br><br>Over time, I realized I wanted to do more than just follow tasks—I wanted to build something real, meaningful, and scalable. That led me to focus on strengthening my core skills again and work on real-world projects that solve real problems. Now, I’m in the phase where I’m continuously building, learning, and growing—actively looking for new challenges and opportunities to contribute to impactful work while learning from talented teams.</p>
